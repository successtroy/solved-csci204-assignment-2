This assignment aims to establish a basic familiarity with C++ classes. The assignment introduces increasingly object-based, C++ style of solution to a problem.General Requirements• Observe the common principles of OO programming when you design yourclasses.• Put your name, student number at the beginning of each source file.• Make proper documentation and implementation comments in your codes where they are necessary.• Logical structures and statements are properly used for specific purposes.ObjectivesOn completion of these tasks you should be able to:• Code and run C++ programs using the development environment.• Make effective use of the on-line documentation system that supports the development environment.• Code programs using C++ in a hybrid style (procedural code using instances of simple classes) and in a more object-based style.• Manipulate string data.Tasks:Task 1: (6.5 marks)A binary code is a type of code that every entry is either 0 or 1. It is very useful in computer science, cryptography, mathematic and engineering. In the computer system, negative binary code represented by its complement value. For example:A decimal number (9)10 is (01001)2 of binary number. A decimal number (-9)10 is (- 01001)2. In the computer system, the negative value usually represented by its complement value, (10111)2, the most significant (highest) bit is 1, indicates the sign of the value is negative. When the leftmost bit is 0, the sign of the value is positive.To get the complement value of a negative binary number, we can invert every bit, add 1 on the inverted value of the binary code. For example: (-9)10 = (-01001)2, to invert binary code, we have (10110)2, to add with 1, we have10110+ 1________10111The complement code of (-01001)2 is (10111)2.In this task, you will define a class BinaryCode in a file BinaryCode.h and implement the C++ program code in a file BinaryCode.cpp.In the class BinaryCode, declare a dynamic array (such as a char pointer or an short integer pointer) to store a binary code, an integer length to store the length of the binary code (includes the sign bit-the most significant bit). Define the following functions in the class BinaryCode.• In the class BinaryCode, you will define default constructor, copy constructor and other initialization constructors to set initial value for a BinaryCode object;• In the class BinaryCode, define following overloading operators:o Extraction operator (&gt;&gt;) to get input binary code from keyboard and save  it in a BinaryCode object;o Insertion operator (&lt;&lt;) to print out the a BinaryCode stream;o Assignment operator(=) to make a deep copy of BinaryCode object.o Invert operator(!) to invert a BinaryCode object.o Complement operator(~) to make a complement BinaryCode object. A complement of a binary code is its invert plus one.o Addition operator (+) to compute two BinaryCode objects’ addition. You should extend two binary streams to the maximum length of both streams plus one so that the significant bits addition won’t be missed. For example:Two binary streams (011011)2 + (01111)2 will be extended (0011011)2 +(0001111)20011011+ 0001111_________0101010o Addition assignment operator (+=) to compute two BinaryCode objects’addition.o Subtraction operation (-) to compute two BinaryCode objects’ subtraction.The subtraction of two BinaryCode objects is defined as:binaryCode1 – binaryCode2 = binaryCode1 + ~(binaryCode2),where ~ is complement operator.o Subtraction assignment operator (-=) to compute two BinaryCode objects’subtraction.o Multiplication operator (*) to compute two BinaryCode objects’multiplication. To compute the multiplication of two BinaryCode objects,each BinaryCode object should be extended as a signed integer. That is toappend number of bits to the left side of a binary stream. Each appendedbit’s value should be the value of the most significant bit’s value of theoriginal binary stream. The new length of binary stream is addition of thetwo binary streams’ length (excludes sign bits).For example, to compute (01001)2 * (10111)2, we will extend two binarystreams to 10 bits (5+5 bits), as (0000001001)2 * (1111110111)2. Thencompute1111110111* 0000001001___________________1111110111+ 1111110111___________________10001110101111.Keep the last (rightmost) 10 bits as the results, which is (1110101111)2,the complement binary code of (-81)10.o Multiplication assignment operator (*=) to compute two BinaryCodes’multiplication.o Shift left operator (&lt;&lt;) to shift a BinaryCodes to left a number of bits. Forexample:(01011)2 &lt;&lt; 3 will be (01011000)2. It is like (01011)2 * 23.o Shift right operator (&gt;&gt;) to use arithmetic shift method shift a BinaryCodeto right a number of bits. For example:(01011)2 &gt;&gt; 2 will be (010)2. It is like (01011)2 / 22.(1010)2 &gt;&gt; 2 will be (110)2.o Other necessary member functions.Implement main() in a file task1Main.cpp to test the functions and operators thatdefined above (See the Testing examples of the task for more details).Testing:Use CC to compile the source files on banshee by$ CC –o task1 task1Main.cpp BinaryCode.cppYou can test the task by run the program$ task1and input data that required.

Implement member functions in a file Date.cpp. The member functionsinclude• A function setDate(int, int, int) takes three parameters of day, month and year andset date for the Date object.• A function setDate(const std::string &amp;) takes a string of date with format“DD/MM/YYYY” and convert the string date to the Date object.“DD/MM/YYYY” represents 2 digits value of day, 2 digits value of month and 4digits value of year with “/” between them.• A function validateDate() validates the date of the Date object. If day is invalid,throw an error message “Invalid day. Day should between 1 and xx.” (where xxis the maximum day for that month). If month is invalid, throw an error message“Invalid month”. If year is invalid, such as less than zero, throw an error message“Invalid year”.• A function toString() converts day, month and year to a string with format“DD/MM/YYYY”.• Other necessary function to return date information.Implement C++ main() function in a file task2Main.cpp that test the member functionsspecified above.
